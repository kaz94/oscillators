function[Qcoef1, Qcoef2, Qcoef3]=co_fcpltri(phi1, phi2, phi3, Dphi1, Dphi2, Dphi3, N)
% DAMOCO Toolbox, function CO_FCPLTRI, version 06.03.14
% Given phases of 3 oscillators and their derivatives, the function yields the coupling functions 
%       q1(phi1, phi2, phi3), 
%       q2(phi2, phi3, phi1), and
%       q3(phi3, phi1, phi2)
% via fitting a Fourier series: exp( i(n*phi1 + m*phi2 +k*phi3) ). 
% The results for each oscillator are given by 3-dimensional matrix of coefficients
%       Qcoef1(n,m,k)
%       Qcoef2(m,k,n)
%       Qcoef3(k,n,m)
% where the indices are associated with the phases as indicated above:
%       n to ph1, 
%       m to phi2
%       k to phi3
% Hence, the first dimension of each matrix always corresponds to the phase, which dynamics
% is represented by the coefficients.
% Form of call: 
%          [Qcoef1, Qcoef2, Qcoef3] = co_fcpltri(phi1, phi2, phi3, or, safr)
%
% Input:   phi1:    phase of the 1st oscillator,
%          phi2:    phase of the 2nd oscillator,
%          phi3:    phase of the 3rd oscillator,
%          Dphi1:   derivative of phi1
%          Dphi2:   derivative of phi2
%          Dphi3:   derivative of phi3
%          N:       order of the Fourier series
% Output:  Qcoef1, Qcoef2, Qcoef3 are Fourier coefficients of the coupling functions
