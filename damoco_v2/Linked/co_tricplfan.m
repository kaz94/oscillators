function [COUP, NORM, OMEGA]=co_tricplfan(Qcoef1, Qcoef2, Qcoef3, meth, thresh)
% DAMOCO Toolbox, function CO_TRICPLFAN, version 12.03.14
%
% This function is a tool to analyze the coupling structure of
% a three oscillator network. Given the Fourier coefficients 
% Qcoef1, Qcoef2, Qcoef3 of the coupling functions, obtained by co_fcpltri,
% co_tricplfan returns the coupling structure in the form of matrix COUP.
%
% The n-th row contains measures of the effect ON the n-th oscillator.
% The m-th column contains measures of the effect CAUSED BY the m-th oscillator.
% For example, COUP(1,2) quantifies effect of node 2 on node 1, 2-->1
%                              0       COUP(1,2)       COUP(1,3)
%                          COUP(2,1)       0           COUP(2,3)
%                          COUP(3,1)   COUP(3,2)       0
% The diagonal is by definition empty, since it would present the effects of an 
% oscillator on itself; this place is however used as discussed below.
%
% COUP is computed by two different techniques, determined by the parameter 'meth' 
%
%   meth = 1 or meth = 2 : PARTIAL NORM
%
%       A non-diagonal element COUP(n,m) is partial norm, i.e. norm of the Fourier terms of the coupling
%       function Qcoefn, depending only on phases n,m (see Ref [4] for details).  
%       A diagonal value COUP(n,n) is the norm of the terms Qcoefn(n,n~0,k~0), i.e. of the terms, 
%       depending on both external phases. 
%       If diagonal terms are not small, the coupling cannot be explained by pairwise interaction 
%       only (see Ref [4]).
%
%
%   meth = 3 or meth = 4   : PARTIAL DERIVATIVE
%
%       The coefficients COUP are computed by means of the norm of the partial
%       derivative with respect to one of external phases. For example
%       the effect of the 2nd oscillator on the first is quantified as: 
%       COUP = sqrt(sum( m^2 Qcoef(n,m,k)^2) ). 
%       The drawback of this method is that noise is enhanced for large order n,m,k.
%       The diagonal terms here are zero.
%
% co_tricplfan also returns the norms of the all coupling functions in the 3-dimensional 
% array NORM and estimates of the autonomous frequencies of the oscillators in the 3-dimensional 
% array OMEGA. 
%
% To reduce numerical / noise effects, a threshold 'thresh' can be chosen in terms of percent 
% of the maximal absolute value of the coefficients Qcoef:
% all coefficients Qcoef with an absolute value smaller than thresh/100*max(abs(Qcoef)) 
% are set to zero. The default value is thresh=2%.
%
% From COUP, which quantifies the interaction of oscillators in absolute values, a relative 
% quantity can be defined by dividing COUP by the autonomous frequency OMEGA of the affected 
% oscillator: 
%           COUP_rel = COUP / OMEGA
% This measure quantify the strength of coupling in relation to autonomous frequency;
% hence, it quantify the tendency to synchronization.
% Output COUP_rel can be chosen by setting meth = 2 or meth = 4.

% INPUT:
%       Qcoef1:         matrix of Fourier coefficients of the coupling function 
%                       of the 1st oscillator, produced by co_fcpltri
%       Qcoef2:         .. of the 2nd oscillator..
%       Qcoef3:         .. of the 3rd oscillator..
%       meth:           (1) (default)= partial norm, (2)= partial norm / omega, (3) = partial derivative, 
%                       (4) = partial derivative / omega 
%       thresh:         threshold for reduction of noise effects (also of computational noise) in terms 
%                       of percent of the maximal absolute value of the coefficients Qcoef: 
%                       thresh = 10 is good choice for dominant components only, the default
%                       value is thresh = 2%; typically this removes numerical artifacts, while keeping 
%                       all other terms. Feel free to vary this parameter [0,..100], to remove noise, etc..
